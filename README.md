# Pet Toy Store - Docker Edition

A simplified Docker-based version of the AWS retail store sample application, focused on local development and testing.

## üè™ About This Project

This project is a **fork and modification** of the official [AWS Retail Store Sample Application](https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app) by Amazon Web Services.

### Original Repository
- **Source**: [aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app](https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app)

### What's Different
This version has been simplified for local development by removing:

The application now runs purely on Docker Compose, making it easier to develop and test locally.
